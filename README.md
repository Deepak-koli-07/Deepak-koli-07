# Hi, I'm Deepak 👋  
Data Analyst building ML & AI Systems | GenAI | Machine Learning | Data Platforms

I design and build intelligent data products by combining strong analytics
foundations with modern machine learning and AI techniques.

My background in data analytics helps me:
- Understand business problems deeply  
- Design clean data pipelines and features  
- Build ML models that solve real-world use cases  
- Deploy production-style ML and AI applications  

My work spans:
- Data analysis and feature engineering  
- End-to-end ML workflows (data → model → app)  
- RAG-based and agentic AI systems  
- Turning raw data into intelligent products  

🔧 Python | SQL | Pandas | Scikit-learn | RAG | LangChain | Streamlit  
📚 Actively building skills in ML, Agentic AI, and production-grade AI systems
